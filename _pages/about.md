I am a third-year PhD student under the supervision of Professor [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj) at Nanjing University. My research mainly focuses on Multilingual, Alignment, and Reasoning. Meanwhile, I am interning at ByteDance Research, focusing on Multilingual LLM Project.

⭐ News
==========
**\[2025-08-21\]** We are thrilled to introduce our latest breakthroughs: `DuPO`, a new preference optimization framework that enables LLMs to perform reliable self-verification and improvement without human annotation or oracle labels.

**\[2025-08-21\]** Our paper "R-PRM: Reasoning-Driven Process Reward Modeling" has been accepted on EMNLP2025 Main.  

**\[2025-07-18\]** We are excited to open-source **Seed-X**, a 7B-parameter multilingual translation LLM that delivers performance comparable to leading closed-source models like Gemini2.5-pro.
