Currently,I am in the second year of a direct PhD program under the supervision of Professor [Shujian Huang](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj) at Nanjing University. My research mainly focuses on Multilingual, Alignment, and Reasoning. Meanwile, I am interning at ByteDance Research, focusing on Multilingual LLM Project.
